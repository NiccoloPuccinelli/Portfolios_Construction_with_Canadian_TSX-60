# Financial Markets Analytics

Here is the work done together with my colleague **Marco Scatassi**. In particular, we built different market portfolios based on various parameters deriving from the regression in the **Market Model** equation and from the application of the **Capital Asset Pricing Model**. The Canadian S&P-TSX60 index was chosen as the basis for the construction.

In this repo you can find the datasets used (`Bonds 5 years.csv`, `Initial sector composition - S&PTSX 60.xlsx` and `S&PTSX 60 - updated.xlsx`), the Python code and the related report in pdf.
